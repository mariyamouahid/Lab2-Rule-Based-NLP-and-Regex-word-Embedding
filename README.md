# Lab 2: NLP Rule-Based Techniques and Word Embedding

## Objective
The primary aim of this lab was to delve into two significant realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP): Rule-Based Techniques utilizing Regular Expressions (Regex), and Word Embedding methodologies.

### Part 1: Rule-Based NLP and Regex
- Developed a Python script to automate the generation of a bill from raw text, leveraging Regex for pattern matching.
- Identified and extracted key information such as product names, quantities, and prices from unstructured text.
- Structured the parsed data into a well-formatted bill, facilitating easy comprehension and analysis.

### Part 2: Word Embedding
- Applied a spectrum of word embedding techniques including one-hot encoding, bag of words, and TF-IDF on the dataset obtained in Lab 1.
- Implemented advanced methods such as Word2Vec (Skip Gram, CBOW), GloVe, and FastText for semantic representation of words.
- Utilized the t-SNE algorithm to visualize the embedded vectors, allowing for comparative analysis of the various techniques.

## Conclusion
- This lab provided invaluable hands-on experience in both Rule-Based NLP and Word Embedding, essential components of NLP.
- Enhanced understanding of Regex and its application in text processing tasks, enabling efficient information extraction from unstructured data.
- Explored the nuances of word embedding techniques, discerning their respective roles and effectiveness in capturing semantic information.
- Equipped with practical skills in implementing NLP methodologies, paving the way for further exploration and application in text analysis and processing tasks.
